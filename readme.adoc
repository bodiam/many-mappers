= Mapper

This is a demo project to test out a few different approaches in mapping objects from on structure to a different structure.

This is useful when you want to build an anticurruption layer, and don't want to expose your DB model to consumers or producers of your app.

Examples for this are:

* Mapping DTOs to a DB model
* Mapping a DB model to a client model
* Many other usecases

== Mapping issues

- Simple Mapping of properties which have the same name and type
  * (Property.reference)
- Mapping of properties which have the same type but a different name
  ** (Property.supplier vs Property.supplierCode)
- Mapping of properties which have the same name but a different type
  ** (Address.country)
  ** (Valuation.premium)
- Deep mapping of same collections
  ** (Valuation.risks)
- Mapping of collections to a non collection
  ** (Valuation.contacts -> Valuation.buyer && Valuation.seller)

- Logic issues, like converting cents to dollars
  ** (Amount.valueInCents vs Amount.valueInDollars)
- Date conversion
  ** (Valuation.dateCreated)

*Ideas - not yet implemented*

- Reference data, like converting country codes to full country names
- Mapping of non collections to collections


== Possible solutions

A few possible solutions are availabe:

- Using frameworks (Dozer, ModelMapper, Orika, etc)
- Mapping by hand
- Building your own custom framework
- Something else.


== Solutions built

Current solutions build are:

== Testing

How to test that all mappings have been correctly applied?

Idea:

* Serialize JSON with GSON and then use https://github.com/lukas-krecan/JsonUnit ?
* https://github.com/skyscreamer/JSONassert
